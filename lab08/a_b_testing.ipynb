A clever method based on random permutations does just that. Tests based on random permutations of the data are called *permutation tests*. If there were no difference between the two distributions in the underlying population, then whether a patient has been in the treatment or control group should make no difference to her final health status. The idea, then, is to shuffle all the labels randomly among the patients. This is called random permutation.\n",
