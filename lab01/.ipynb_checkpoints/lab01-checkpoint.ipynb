    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it is encouraged! You should rarely be stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please do not just share answers, though.\n",
