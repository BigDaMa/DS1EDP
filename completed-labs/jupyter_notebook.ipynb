    "# Setup/Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first lab of Data Science 1: Essentials of Data Programming!  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Administrative Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Labs\n",
    "Every week you will complete one lab work like this one. Whenever, we announce that a new lab notebook is released, you can receive it by clicking on the *pull repository* link in the ISIS page.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Labs Attendance\n",
    "Attending the labs is strongly recommended but not mandatory. However, you cannot learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course. Furthermore, you will need the experience to do the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Colaboration\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it is encouraged! You should rarely be stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. Please do not just share answers, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. Homework\n",
    "You will have one homework biweekly. Submitting the homeworks is mandatory and we will grade them. Only students who received more than the minimum required homework credit are eligible for the exam. Whenever, we announce that a new homework with a particular deadline is released, you should do the followings:\n",
    "1. Go to the *Assignments* tab.\n",
    "2. Select the latest homework and press the *Fetch* button.\n",
    "3. Open the new notebook and answer the questions.\n",
    "4. Save the notebook with the menu *Save and Checkpoint*.\n",
    "5. Submit the homework with the *Submit* button.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can submit a homework as many times as you want. The last submission is always stored and graded. Make sure that you submit your homework always before the deadline. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5. Getting Feedback\n",
    "Your homework will be graded automatically as you are more than 100 students. So, it is not feasible for us to manually grade your homework and give you personal feedback. However, we publish the solutions after the deadline of each homework, so you can check your solution against ours. The following algorithm helps you evaluate your solotions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each question with P points in the homework notebook, you have your answer and our released answer.\n",
    "+ If your answer is the same as our answer:\n",
    "    + Then everything is fine and you have got the P points.\n",
    "+ Else:\n",
    "    + Run both your answer and our answer.\n",
    "    + If both answers generate the same results:\n",
    "        + Again everything is fine and we just have different solutions for the same problem. In this case, maybe our auto grader script fails to give you the P points but that does not change the fact that you were right.\n",
    "    + Else:\n",
    "        + In this case, you were probably wrong. You may want to think about our solution to understand your mistake.  If you could not understand your mistake, which should be a very rare event, you may send your specific question to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6. Contacting US\n",
    "Let us repeat together that\n",
    "> ISIS is a terrorist group, not a messenger!\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot check and reply to ISIS messages. So, please only contact us by **email**. You can find our email addresses on our research group website (https://www.bigdama.tu-berlin.de/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, You are more than 100 students. Handling the emails and questions of this number of students would be hard for anybody. So, we will be grateful if, before sending any email to us, you ask the following questions from yourself:\n",
    "- Do I really need to know the answer?\n",
    "    - Maybe, knowing the exact population of the earth would be just a useless piece of information for you.\n",
    "- Do I not know the answer of this question?\n",
    "    - Maybe, we already answered this question several times in the introductory slides or notebooks.\n",
    "- Does it make any difference to know the answer of this question?\n",
    "    - Maybe, the answer of this question does not make any difference for your latent goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.7. Labs and Homework Overview\n",
    "The overview of our labs and homework will be more or less as follows.\n",
